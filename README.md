# BetterDiscord
Contains code for some BetterDiscord themes. Most of these are stolen (to be fair I stole it from open-source code). These are only tested for Windows 10 19041-19045, and so may not work on Windows 11, macOS or Linux. 
If you have a problem, too bad (just kidding I will try to look into it). 

These themes are either directly stolen without any modifications or stolen and then split into microthemes. 

## Themes
- Windows Titlebar (tries to restore default Windows titlebar)
- Fluent Basic (replaces font and icons; tries to replicate 2023 profiles)
- Basic Background (basic background by DevilBro, but I remove icons and add blur)
- macOS titlebar (directly stolen from discord-extensions, replicates macOS titlebar for Windows)
- 2023Profile (Tries to return 2023-2024 Discord Profile, DO NOT use with Fluent-Basic, instead replace OG Profile section of Fluent-Basic)
