# Changelog and progress update
This is here for changelog and progress update (no way!?!?!). Mostly for tracking what I need to get done and stuff, but you can use it to see if I'm slacking (I probably am).

## Changelog

- **Changelog 1.21**: Fixed bugs (Discord stop changing class names) with body of profile, adjusted for Discord updates
- **Changelog 1.20**: Fixed roles overlapping with note button, profiles look kinda weird still because extra margin on descriptionClamp
- **Changelog 1.20 Beta**: Finally got around to fixing the note button, a few pixels offset but good enough
- **Changelog 1.16**: Finally added support for new Discord release, notes are still broken as of now (they appear but always on the "Message user" textbox). 
- **Changelog 1.15**: Added "VIEW PROFILE" text, added a notes section, still a bug because Notes section is measured relative to top rather than relative to desc. clamp, will fix (if possible) in 1.2 
- **Changelog 1.1**: Added support for custom status messages, added line break between name/status and desc. clamp
- **Changelog 1.0**: Added "ABOUT ME" text, allowed for up to 19 lines of desc. clamp, allowed support for badges and made them better (3px padding + 10px border-radius)
- **Changelog 0.5**: Allowed for up to 7 lines of desc. clamp, added centre thing to resemble 2023 profiles (BG of body is no longer solid colour), added and removed linebreak (no padding at bottom)
- **Changelog 0.1**: Planning, used OldCord CSS and old profile pictures from web to see what was needed, created CSS File
