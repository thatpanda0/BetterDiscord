# BetterDiscord
Contains code for some BetterDiscord themes. 

These themes are either directly stolen without any modifications or stolen and then split into microthemes. 

## Themes
- Windows Titlebar (tries to restore default Windows titlebar)
- Fluent Basic (replaces font and icons; tries to replicate 2023 profiles)
- Basic Background (basic background by DevilBro, but I remove icons and add blur)
- macOS titlebar (directly stolen from discord-extensions, replicates macOS titlebar for Windows)
- 2023Profile
