# BetterDiscord
Contains code for some BetterDiscord themes. 

These themes are either directly stolen without any modifications or stolen and then split into microthemes. 

## Themes
- Windows Titlebar (tries to restore default Windows titlebar)
- Basic Background (basic background by DevilBro, but I remove icons and add blur)
- 2023Profile
- E (Changes titlebar to Teams-like titlebar)
- F (changes emojis, still in alpha testing)
- MessageBubbles (message bubbles)
